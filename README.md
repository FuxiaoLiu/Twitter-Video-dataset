## Abstract 
We introduce COVID-VTS, a fact-checking dataset for short video platforms. We propose an effective approach to automatically generate large-scale verifiable, trustworthy as well as misleading claims rather than employing human annotators. We propose TwtrDetective, a new explainable fact-checking framework for the short video platform.
